### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
**Who I am and where I come from?**
My name is **Wojciech Bukowski**, and I come from a small village near Zakopane in southern Poland.

**My Background & Passions**
I'm an economist by education and a freelance programmer by passion. I graduated from the University of Economics in KrakÃ³w, but over the years, coding has become my true calling. I find joy in solving problems through code and continuously pushing my skills to the next level.

Beyond programming, I have a passion for languages. Currently, Iâ€™m learning Spanish, Hungarian, English, and German â€“ each one broadening my perspective and inspiring new ways to think and create.

**Services Offered**
If youâ€™re interested in collaborating on a project or just want to chat about coding or languages, feel free to reach out.

**I'm proficient in:**
